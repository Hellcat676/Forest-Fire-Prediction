FOREST FIRE PREDICTION

Welcome to the Forest Fire Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict forest fires based on environmental factors using machine learning techniques. The predictive models implemented include Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

OVERVIEW

Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems and human settlements worldwide. Early detection and prediction of forest fires can help mitigate their impact and facilitate timely response measures. This project leverages historical data on environmental parameters such as temperature, oxygen concentration, and humidity to predict the likelihood of a forest fire occurrence.

KEY FEATURES

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the forest fire dataset to prepare it for model training.
Multiple Models: Implement various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machines for prediction.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
User Interaction: Allow users to input environmental parameters to predict the probability of a forest fire.
